# Simple-Interest-Calculator

This is a simple interest calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
In this first you need to enter Loan Amount, then Rate of Interest and then for how many years.

Then The calculate() function acts as the handler for the on click event of the button. 
That is, when the user clicks the button Calculate, the calculate() function is executed.

The function should get the values that the user has entered into the input boxes. 
In order to do this, it uses the document.getElementById() method and the value property. 
After the calculation, the result is put inside a paragraph element using the same mechanism (assignment instead of reading, this time).
